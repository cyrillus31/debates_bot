##### https://t.me/debate_topics_bot

This bot allows you to generate a single topic or a bunch of topics for your debates and allow Telegram users to pick sides they want to defend. You can re-roll a topic if you don't like it right away.

You can add new topics in your language via PullRequest to this repo. Questions are located at [src/topics/](src/topics/) 

### Technologies:
- python
- sqlite3
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- pyTelegramBotAPI

## Commands

The bot is in its early stage so it has only a few commands:

`/get_topic - Receive one random topic for debate`  
`/get_multiple - Receive multiple topics at once`
